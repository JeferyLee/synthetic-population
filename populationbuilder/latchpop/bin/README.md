# Building the LATCH ABM Population 

This project builds the LATCH ABM population, using input ABS census data.


## Build Instructions

There are 4 maven projects that needs to be built. They are all subprojects of `intg` project. To build all the 4 projects at once change directory to `anonymous/sources/intg` and execute below command.

        > mvn clean install


## Run Instructions

To run the code and generate the latch population, change directory to `anonymous/sources/intg/latchpop/` and do:

        > java -jar target/latchpop.jar latchpop.properties
 
## Output file

The program produces 3 files contaning all househods, all families and all persons. Files are saved to `anonymous/data/latch/locationaldata/`

## latchpop.properties file instructions

This file contains all the properties for constructing the popoulation

* `SA2InputDataDirectory` -  Location of processed household and individual input data files by SA2. Each directory represents an SA2. There must be 3 files named Hh.csv, Indiv.csv and SA1Hhs.csv. These files are generated by the preprocessing program.
* `SA1HhDistFileProperties` - Properties of file describing distribution of different family households types in SA1s within an SA1.
* `RandomSeed` - Seed for random number generator
* `SA2List` - Comma seperated list of SA2 names. There must be a directory for each SA2 name in `SA2InputDataDirectory`
* `SA2OutputLocation` - Output location of the constructed population by SA2
* `SA1OutputLocation` - Output location of the constructed population by SA1
* `AllHouseholdsCsv` - Output file containing all the households in whole population
* `AllFamiliesCsv` - Output file containing all the families in whole population
* `AllAgentsCsv` - Output file containing all the agens in whole population
* `SACodesZip` - The zip file downloaded from ABS containing all the Statistical Area codes. This is used to convert from one code to another. (Download 'Statistical Area Level 1 (SA1) ASGS Edition 2011 in .csv Format' zip file from this [link](http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/DetailsPage/1270.0.55.001July%202011))
* `SACodesCsvInSACodesZip` - Name of the relavent csv file in above zip
* `ReferenceColumnHeader` - The column name (code identifier) of the code we want to convert from
* `TargetColumnHeader` - The column name (code identifier) of the code we want to convert to
* `EnableSummaryReports` - generate summary of household and person distribution for each SA2 if value is set to 'true'
